## Basics

### UI

The default windows are:

* Hierarchy - shows the game objects on the scene
* Scene - visual representation of the scene
* Game - view from the player's perspective
* Asset store - 
* Inspector - displays the components of the selected game object
* Project - file view of the project
* Console - displays log messages from C# scripts and errors/warnings

Key bindings:

* ctrl+p - toggles the play button
* f - focus on the highlighted object in the hierarchy
* ctrl+d - duplicate selected game object

### Scripts

Making fields public allow Unity to see them, and make them editable in the Unity editor.

* FixedUpdate() - smoother rendering for physics-based updates

## Workflow

### Prefabs

You can drag game objects into the assets window to create what is known as a   
_Prefab_. This allows us to drag and drop multiple instances of that game object.
Clicking on the prefab and altering values alters all objects created from that
prefab. Individual instance's values can also be altered, in order to reflect
that change to other prefab objects, you would have to click **Apply**.
