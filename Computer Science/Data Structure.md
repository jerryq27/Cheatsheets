# Data Structures

## List

A list should be able to:

* Access elements
* Add elements
* Remove elements
* Insert elements

## Array List

Array lists use arrays (which are just large blocks of allocated memory) as the underlying structure.
Since arrays cannot be recreated, modifying a list will require the creation of a new list,
and copying values over based on the modification.

## Linked List

Accessing elements - O(n), since it requires searching the whole list from the head node.
