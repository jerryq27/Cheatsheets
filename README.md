# Cheatsheets

These are some cheatsheets I wrote whenever I study a new programming language,
library, framework, tool, or any other technological topic. They are meant to be
a quick reference whenever I need to revisit one of these technologies. This
repository is using the following directory structure:

1. Languages - programming languages.
1. Libraries, Tools, & Frameworks - contains tools and which type of development
they are usually used in.
1. Topics - general topics with concepts that are shared between multiple files.
1. Tutorials - contains projects, source code from tutorials and books. and follows
the same structure as the cheatsheets.

## Workflow

A new branch is created whenever a new study is being done. They are merged back
into master when the draft reaches a satisfactory point. New cheatsheets will
use the following templates:
